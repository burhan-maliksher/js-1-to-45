// 20.Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages,
//    or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// initializing an array 
const  languageList=["Urdu","Punjabi","English","Arabic","Persian"];

// displaying list stored in an array 
console.log(languageList);
